just starting the readme. 
### Project gaols
Create a site to hold all the insights we can gather in a reference format,
useful to document the gospel of how to do stuff right with particular
reference to the Kubernetes cloud native devops world we work in now.

If possible can the site work in a dual mode, on the one hand a searchable
structured sectioned reference, and also a blog type structure for things that
dont fit or aren't ready for including in a reference.

What about a podcast :) That wouldn't be hard and loads of work right
